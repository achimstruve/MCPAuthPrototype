# =============================================================================
# .dockerignore — files excluded from the Docker build context
# =============================================================================
#
# When you run `docker build`, Docker sends the entire directory (the "build
# context") to the Docker daemon. This file tells Docker which files to skip.
#
# Why this matters:
# - Smaller build context = faster builds (less data to send to daemon)
# - Prevents secrets (.env, .git credentials) from ending up in the image
# - Prevents unnecessary cache invalidation (changes to tests shouldn't
#   trigger a rebuild of the app image)
#
# Pattern: exclude everything that isn't needed at runtime.
# The Dockerfile only needs: pyproject.toml, uv.lock, src/, documents/
