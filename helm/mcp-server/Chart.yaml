# Chart.yaml - Helm Chart Metadata
# =============================================================================
#
# This file is the "identity card" of the Helm chart. Helm reads it to
# understand what this chart is, what version it is, and what application
# it deploys.
#
# Every Helm chart MUST have a Chart.yaml at its root. Without it, Helm
# doesn't recognize the directory as a chart.
#
# Key concepts:
# - A "chart" is a package of Kubernetes manifests (like a .deb or .rpm
#   for Kubernetes). It's a template that can be installed multiple times
#   with different configurations.
# - A "release" is a specific installation of a chart. When you run
#   `helm install my-release ./mcp-server`, "my-release" is the release name.
# =============================================================================

# apiVersion v2 is the Helm 3 format. Helm 2 used v1.
# Helm 3 removed the server-side component (Tiller) and is the current standard.
apiVersion: v2

# Chart name. Used in template helpers to generate Kubernetes resource names.
# Convention: lowercase, hyphen-separated (matches Kubernetes naming rules).
name: mcp-server

# Human-readable description. Shows up in `helm search` results and
# artifact repositories (like Artifact Hub).
description: >-
  Secure MCP server with JWT authentication and scope-based tool access.
  Deploys to GKE with External Secrets Operator integration for secret
  management via GCP Secret Manager.

# Chart type: "application" or "library".
# - application: Deploys Kubernetes resources (what we want)
# - library: Provides reusable templates for other charts (no resources of its own)
type: application

# Chart version. Follows Semantic Versioning (semver.org):
# - MAJOR: incompatible changes to values.yaml or templates
# - MINOR: new features (new templates, new values) that are backwards-compatible
# - PATCH: bug fixes
#
# This version tracks the CHART (packaging/templates), NOT the application.
# Increment this whenever you change any file in the chart.
version: 0.1.0

# Application version. This is the version of the SOFTWARE being deployed.
# It maps to the Docker image tag. When CI builds a new image (e.g., with
# a git SHA tag), this value gets updated.
#
# The distinction matters:
# - Chart version 0.1.0 could deploy app version v1, v2, or v3
# - You might update the chart (version 0.2.0) without changing the app
# - ArgoCD and `helm list` show both versions for clarity
appVersion: "v1"
